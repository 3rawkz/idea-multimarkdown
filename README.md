idea-multimarkdown
==================

**[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) language support for [IntelliJ IDEA](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea), [RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby), [PhpStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm), [WebStorm](http://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm), [PyCharm](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm), [AppCode](http://www.jetbrains.com/objc) and [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html).**

See the [official plugin page](http://plugins.intellij.net/plugin?id=).

I wanted a Markdown preview plug-in that resembled GitHub's markdown style. I decided to start with [Markdown plug-in](https://github.com/nicoulaj/idea-markdown), upgrade it to latest pegdown, parboiled
 then add a few creature comforts for others like user settable style sheet so you don't need to rebuild the plug-in just to change the style, fix a few bugs then add other comforts like 
 the ability to split ide editors and display Markdown in one pane and HTML Preview in the other, with the preview automatically updated as you type.

*This plugin is based on the excellent [Markdown plug-in](https://github.com/nicoulaj/idea-markdown) by [nicoulaj](https://github.com/nicoulaj), 
which is based on [PegDown](http://pegdown.org) library by [sirthias](https://github.com/sirthias).
