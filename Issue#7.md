MultiMarkdown Plugin

An issue with rendering icons when the UI theme is **Darcula** prevents bullet and task list items from using these options. These settings will be ignored while **Darcula** theme is in effect and until the issue is fixed.

&nbsp;

Feel free leave the *Bullets with Icons* and *Tasks with Icons* options turned on. They will take effect when they do not adversely affect the display.
